## Overview

### The challenge

In this Challenge, a marketing agency has hired me to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible.

### User Story

As a marketing agency, we want a codebase that follows accessibility standards so that our own site is optimized for search engines.

### Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards

WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements

WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes

WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order

WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://your-live-site-url.com)

## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS

### Continued development

As a new software developer, I want to continue to use semantic elements in my own code as a way to help build useful habits and easy identification. My goal is to develop the skills necessary to create and format my own website.

### Useful resources

- [Semantic Elements](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp) - This resource helped me identify which elements I could use to replace ```<div class="">``` to help other developers navigate through the code.
